This is a fantastic combination of influences. It’s a very specific, highly engaging niche.
You are essentially trying to merge the crunchy, utilitarian, beige-box aesthetic of System 7 era Macintosh with the soft, character-driven, dopamine-hit cuteness of Sanrio and Pokémon.
This fusion creates a genre we might call "Kawaii-Retro Computing."
It’s not about stress or high scores; it’s about the satisfying crunch of pixelated grass turning into clean digital space, guided by adorable mascots.
Here is a brand identity proposal for your meditative mowing game.

1. The Brand Ethos & Vibe
The core feeling should be the digital equivalent of a warm blanket and a cup of tea, played on an old, friendly computer that hums contentedly.
 * The Nostalgia Hook: The chunky sounds of a floppy drive inserting, the "happy Mac" startup icon, the satisfying click of old mechanical keyboards.
 * The Cozy Hook: The satisfaction of clearing a messy space, collecting cute things, and low-stakes gameplay where you can't really "lose."
 * The Brand Voice: Gentle, encouraging, slightly digitized, and very sweet. Think of a computer operating system that loves you unconditionally.

2. Visual Identity: "Soft Retro"
We need to bridge the gap between stark 1-bit Macintosh graphics and the colorful world of Sanrio.
The "Color Classic" Palette:
Instead of pure black and white, we use a limited, dithered color palette that feels like an early 90s color CRT monitor trying its best to render pastel cuteness.
 * Beige Box (UI Backgrounds): #F2E9D8 (Warm, aged plastic)
 * Pixel Mint (The Grass): #A8D8B9 (Soft, desaturated green)
 * Muted Rose (Accents/Flowers): #E8B4B8 (A dusty pink)
 * Sky Blue Grey (Water/UI Highlights): #A2C4C9 (Cool, calming blue)
 * Charcoal (Text/Outlines): #3E3E3E (Not harsh black, but a soft dark gray)
Typography:
 * Primary Header Font: A pixelated, chunky serif font reminiscent of the classic Apple "Chicago" font used in old Mac menus, or a cute bitmap font (like those used on a Game Boy Color).
 * Body Font: A clean, readable pixel font designed for small sizes.
Graphics Style:
 * Heavy use of dithering (checkerboard pixel patterns) to create shading, mimicking old monitor limitations.
 * Thick, chunky window borders with visible pixel shadows.
 * Icons that look like they belong on an old desktop (a trash can that looks happy when you feed it grass clippings).

3. The Protagonist (The "Sanrio" Factor)
Since your audience loves character-driven IPs like Pokémon and Hello Kitty, the mower cannot just be a machine. It needs a soul.
The Character Concept: The "Mow-Bot"
It’s a small, round, autonomous mowing robot. It looks like a cross between an old Macintosh SE computer and a Roomba, with big, expressive pixel eyes on its "screen."
 * When it mows, it doesn't emit smoke; it emits little pixelated hearts or flower petals.
 * It makes cheerful 8-bit beeps and boops when it clears a patch perfectly.

4. Naming & Tagline Concepts
Here are three distinct directions for the name, keeping the "Cozy Mac" vibe in mind.

Concept A: The Digital Gardener Approach
This direction leans into the satisfying aspect of managing a digital space. It feels organized and clean.
 * Name: Desktop Garden
 * Tagline: A tidy space for a tidy mind.
 * The Vibe: Very System 7. The icon looks like a folder with a flower sticking out of it.

Concept B: The Cute Character Approach
This direction focuses on the mascot and the Sanrio-adjacent appeal.
 * Name: Beeper’s Patch
 * Tagline: Mow, relax, repeat. beep!
 * The Vibe: Focuses on the little robot buddy. Very friendly and inviting. "Beeper" is the name of the mow-bot.

Concept C: The Aesthetic Fusion (Recommended)
This is the strongest route, combining the retro tech with the cozy nature theme.
 * Name: Pixel Meadow
 * Tagline: Reboot your relaxation.
 * Alternative Taglines: "Cultivate calm, one pixel at a time." or "Your daily digital zen."
 * Why it works: "Pixel" immediately grounds it in the retro aesthetic. "Meadow" is softer and cozier than "lawn" or "grass." It promises an escape.

Summary Idea Board for "Pixel Meadow"
If we go with Pixel Meadow as the leading concept:
 * The App Icon: A beige floppy disk with a small, pixelated sprout growing out of the metal shutter.
 * The Loading Screen: A beige background with a progress bar that says "Loading Serenity..." while a small pixelated hourglass spins.
 * Victory State: When you finish mowing a level, the screen doesn't flash "YOU WIN." Instead, a low-res window pops up with a satisfying "chime" sound that says: “The meadow is tranquil. Good job, friend.”
 *
