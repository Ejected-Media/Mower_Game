This is getting exciting. Merging SimCity (economy/management), Escape Velocity (ship/hull progression), and After Dark (aesthetic) into an idle game is a solid hook.
For "Version 2.0," we are going to introduce Depth.
New Features in v2.0:
Hull Progression (The Escape Velocity touch): You don't just upgrade stats; you buy entirely new chassis.
The Push Mower: Slow, small tank.
The Rider: Fast, big tank.
The Zero-Turn: Agile, high efficiency.
The Hover-Deck: Sci-fi tech, ignores obstacles.
Automation (The SimCity touch): Buying upgrades that remove the need for you to manually click "Sell" or "Refuel." This shifts the game from "Clicker" to "Manager."
Durability & Repair: Rocks now damage your blade. You must pay to repair, adding a survival element.
Persistence: The game now saves your progress to your browser's local storage. You can close the tab and come back later.
The Code (v2.0)
Here is the fully upgraded single-file web prototype.

Key Strategies for Playing v2.0
The Grind (Early Game): You start with the "Rusty Push Mower." It is slow and has a tiny bag. You will need to manually click "Empty Bag" constantly.
First Major Milestone: Save up for the LawnKing Rider ($500). This changes the game feel immediately. It moves faster and holds 5x more grass.
The Automation Era: Once you buy the Auto-Bagger ($1500), the game plays itself (mostly). You only need to worry about Fuel and Repairs.
End Game: The Grav-Mow 3000 hovers, meaning rocks (which usually damage your mower) can be ignored entirely.
Enjoy your new empire, Mowing Tycoon!
