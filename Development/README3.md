That sounds like a great plan! Taking time to play-test is the best way to figure out what the "fun" loop really is—you might find that the fuel drains too fast, or maybe earning money feels too slow in the beginning.
When you are ready to come back for Version 3.0, we could look into adding Weather Effects (rain grows grass faster), a Fleet System (owning multiple mowers at once), or even Achievements.
Have fun managing your mowing empire, and I'll be here when you're ready for the next update

___

We are moving from "Owner-Operator" (driving your own mower) to "Fleet Commander" (SimTower/Tycoon style).
In Version 3.0, we introduce:
The Drone Fleet: You can now purchase autonomous "Mini-Bots." These don't need fuel; they just roam and mow. They are slow and dumb, but they are loyal.
Contract System (Map Selection): You aren't stuck in the backyard anymore. You can now accept contracts for the City Park (lots of rocks) and the Golf Course (huge payouts, very fast growth).
Visual "Juice": Added particle effects. Grass explodes into little green pixels when cut. It makes the game feel much more alive.
Dynamic Camera: Since the maps are now larger than your screen, the camera smoothly follows your main mower (SimCity style).
Here is Mower Tycoon v3.0: The Fleet Update
