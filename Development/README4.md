That is a great idea. Giving you manual control effectively turns the game into a "Snake" hybrid, allowing you to dodge rocks or chase specific patches of tall grass manually when you want to intervene.
I have updated the game to Version 4.0.
Changes in Version 4.0:
Manual Override Controls: Added a D-Pad to the "Command" tab. You can now tap (or use arrow keys on your keyboard) to steer the mower. The mower will continue moving in that direction until it hits a wall or you steer again.
Slower Base Speed: I reduced the starting speed significantly (from 8 frames/move to 15 frames/move). This makes the game more relaxing and gives you time to react to rocks.
Visual Feedback: The buttons light up when pressed to confirm the command was sent.
Here is Mower Tycoon v4.0.
