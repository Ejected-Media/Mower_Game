I understand exactly what you mean. The first version felt more "arcadey" and immediate—you could see the whole lawn at once (no scrolling), and the controls were right there. The later versions got a bit "spreadsheet-heavy" with all the tabs.
Here is Mower Tycoon: Arcade Edition.
The Hybrid Design
Single Screen View (No Scrolling): Just like Version 1, the entire map fits on your screen. The tiles automatically resize: if you load a huge map (like the Golf Course), the tiles get smaller to fit everything in view. This restores that "Screensaver" feeling.
V1 Interface: The D-Pad is back on the main screen, always available.
V4 Features (Hidden Complexity): The deep features (Fleets, Hulls, Contracts) are tucked away in a "Shop" button so they don't clutter the arcade experience.
Action Focused: The "Sell" and "Refuel" buttons are big and right next to the D-Pad for quick tapping

Key features of the Arcade Edition:
Automatic Zoom: If you buy the "Golf Course" contract, the tiles will shrink to fit the whole course on your screen. If you play the "Backyard," they get big and chunky.
Hidden Depth: Tap the orange "SHOP / MAPS" button to find all the complex stuff (Contract buying, Drone purchases, Hull upgrades).
Visual Indicators: The "Sell" and "Refuel" buttons flash when you need to press them (Bag Full / Low Fuel).
