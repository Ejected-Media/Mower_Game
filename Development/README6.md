Here is the updated mower_game. I have reverted the mower design to the classic Red/Black, updated the maps to a horizontal 16:9 aspect ratio, and added a Throttle Slider so you can control the speed dynamically.
Changes in this Version:
16:9 Horizontal Maps: The "Backyard," "City Park," and "Golf Course" are now wide rectangles to fit the requested aspect ratio.
Classic Mower Design: The mower is bright red with distinct black wheels.
Speed Control (Throttle): A slider in the control panel allows you to slow down for precision (dodging rocks) or speed up to mow clear patches quickly.
Note: Higher speed burns fuel slightly faster!
Rebranding: All references to "Tycoon" are gone. It is simply mower_game
