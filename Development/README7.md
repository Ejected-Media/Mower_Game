This version brings together the specific design elements you requested:
Warcraft-Style Top HUD: The resources (Gold, Fuel, Bag) are now permanently fixed to the top of the screen in a black bar with gold text, just like the classic RTS games.
After Dark Movement Logic: When the mower hits the left or right edge of the screen, it now shifts down one row and turns around (a "serpentine" or "scanline" pattern), rather than bouncing randomly.
Classic V1 UI: I brought back the clean, rounded button aesthetics and the "Control Panel" layout from the first version.
Red & Black Mower: The classic sprite returns.
