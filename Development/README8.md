Here is the updated mower_game.
Changes in this Version:
Vertical "Snake" Movement: If the mower hits the top or bottom edge while moving vertically, it will now shift one tile to the right and turn around (just like the horizontal behavior).
"Bag Full" Drift: When the bag is full, the mower keeps moving but stops cutting grass. The grass will pass underneath it uncut until you sell your clippings.
N64-Style Analog Stick: The D-Pad has been replaced with a virtual "Analog Stick" inside an octagonal gate. It supports 8-way movement, allowing you to mow diagonally!
