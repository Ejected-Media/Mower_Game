Here is the updated mower_game.
Changes in this Version:
4-Stage Grass Growth with Texture:
Grass now grows in 4 stages (0-3).
Stage 0 (Cut): Light green, no texture.
Stage 1-3 (Growing): Progressively darker shades of green with drawn grass blade lines for a textured look.
Cutting any growth stage immediately resets it to Stage 0.
"Cash" Currency:
The top HUD now labels your money as "Cash" instead of "Gold".
New UI Feature: Dynamic Weather System:
I've added a Weather Indicator to the top HUD (e.g., ☀️ Sunny, ☁️ Cloudy, 🌧️ Rainy).
The weather changes periodically and directly affects the game: Rain makes grass grow twice as fast!
